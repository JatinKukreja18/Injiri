            <h1>BELIEFS</h1>
            <p>Injiri works with hand-loom textiles for clothing and home. The label is entirely based on the idea of celebrating the process of hand-woven and hand-crafted Indian textiles; the clothes are little stories about the textiles they are made
                of, and are reflective of the process that goes into making of their textiles.</p>
            <p>
                India has been the producer of highly skilled textiles for many centuries and these textiles have travelled the world. Injiri is a colloquial pronunciation of the word"in- dia". It is a historic word for "real madras checkered textiles" that were exported
                from South India to west Africa in the 18th century. The name “in-jee-ree” is suggestive of the idea of Indian textiles being prized possessions of people all over the world. The label believes in working within the limitations of the
                techniques to create beauti- ful products. It means to allow the technique to generate innumerable possibilities of how beauty can be achieved. It could be the most obvious or simplest solutions - but in simplicity we think lies absolute
                beauty.

                The inspiration for most of the textiles and garments comes from local dressing styles of rural India and other folk cultures from around the world. It is the simplest work - clothes of peasants, tribals and local people that inspire us the most. Most
                vintage clothes like smocks were made at home or by a local seamstress. In olden days making clothes was a very slow process and allowed the maker to do each piece at leisure - also woven material was a precious commodity and it was used
                frugally. The “hand-made” quality is very evident and all our products are inspired by that over and over again. Injiri was launched in 2009 by Chinar. Injiri started as a clothing label and diversified into home textiles in 2011. And
                now it is placed in over 300 stores across the worl d

            <h1>THE FOUNDER</h1>
            <p>
                Chinar Farooqui is a textile and clothing designer based in Japur, Rajasthan, India. Her passion lies in studying traditional textiles and dress, and the stories behind them. One can often find her spending hours in museums studying the folk garment collections.
                She finds a lot of inspiration from her travels, observing local lifestyles of people. Founded in 2009, her label 'Injiri' is an outcome of her interests in traditional textiles and dresses.

                Chinar's designs do not intend to follow seasonal fashion. Instead, they stem from her appreciation for traditional Indian textile techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The design that one finds in my products are mainly the textile designs which are incorporated while weaving a piece of fabric on the loom like selvedge (or self-edge of a woven fabric), borders, cross borders, and weaving patterns. I use the hand-woven
                fabric for clothes in such a way that the textile design becomes apparent and it also becomes the most important design feature of that garment. The inspiration for most of the garments comes from local dressing styles of rural India and
                other folk cultures from around the world. It is the simplest work clothes of peasants, farmers and common man that inspires me the most."
